```cs
var countByNumber = rightNumbers.CountBy(it => it).ToFrozenDictionary();
```

Tried the [Math.BigMul](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.math.bigmul?view=net-9.0#system-math-bigmul(system-int32-system-int32)) API for the first time.

```cs
long AggregateFunc(long acc, int number) =>
    acc + Math.BigMul(number, countByNumber.GetValueOrDefault(number, 0));
```
